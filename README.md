# Women_of_Heresies
The Heresies Magazine was feminist magazine published from 1977 until 1993. 
The authors as well as publishers of Heresies were involved in the art world as well as the political and feminist discourse and formed one of the centers of the feminist scene in New York City at the time. 
Each issue focused on a different topic (spirituality, racism, women in theater etc.) 
and was created by a different group of volunteers, called “Issue Collectives”, under the guidance of the “Mother Collective”, in which members largely remained constant. 
In the magazine, many of the articles published reference notable feminist writers and works that were influential to the feminist movement of the time.
With a total of 27 issues, there is a large network of feminist authors and artists that contributed to the magazine and shaped the New York City feminist scene of the late Seventies to early Nineties. 
Luckily, this network can be retraced as all issues have been archived and made available online.

We have worked with Neo4j.
