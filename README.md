# The Women of Heresies
The Heresies Magazine was a feminist magazine published from 1977 until 1993 in New York City. 
The authors as well as publishers of Heresies were involved in the art world as well as the political and feminist discourse and formed one of the centers of the feminist scene in NYC at the time. 
Each issue focuses on a different topic (spirituality, racism, women in theater etc.) and was created by  different groups of volunteers, called “Issue Collectives”, under the guidance of the “Mother Collective”, in which members largely remained constant. 
In Heresies, many of the articles published reference notable feminist writers and works that were essential to the feminist movement at the time.
With a total of 27 issues, there is a huge network of feminist authors and artists that contributed to the magazine and shaped not only the feminist scene in New York City but also all over the world.  
Luckily, this network can be retraced as all issues have been archived and made available online.
This is why we have decided to create a Social Network Analysis so this amazing Cosmos of feminist history will not be lost.
